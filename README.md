# COVID-19 Medical Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes real-world COVID-19 medical data to identify infection trends, mortality rates, hospitalizations, and vaccination impact. The project applies data science techniques learned from Cisco NetAcad courses:
- Introduction to Data Science
- Data Analytics Essentials

## Dataset
Source: Our World in Data (Global COVID-19 Dataset) https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases
- Not including data-set as it is too large

## Objectives
- Analyze COVID-19 case growth
- Study mortality trends
- Explore hospital and ICU demand
- Investigate vaccination impact

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Findings - COVID-19 Medical Impact in South Africa

South Africa’s COVID-19 mortality rate peaked during early waves and showed a gradual decline following the national vaccination rollout, indicating improved clinical outcomes and population-level immunity.
The analysis demonstrates strong temporal relationships between infection rates, hospital burden, and mortality. A clear decline in fatality rates following vaccine deployment highlights the effectiveness of public health interventions and improved clinical response over the course of the pandemic.

- South Africa experienced multiple infection waves, visible through sharp increases in total and new case counts.
- The national mortality rate remained below 5% for most of the pandemic, indicating effective clinical management and public health interventions.
- Peak mortality aligned with major waves during 2020–2021.
- Hospital and ICU admissions increased significantly during each wave, placing measurable strain on healthcare infrastructure.
- Vaccination rollout corresponded with a long-term decline in mortality and severe cases.
- The 7-day rolling average smooths reporting noise and clearly highlights transmission cycles.

This analysis demonstrates how time-series medical data can be transformed into actionable public health insights using Python and Pandas.
